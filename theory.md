# LIDAR

## Light Detection and Ranging

LIDARs são equipamentos de uso não muito frequentes ainda por um motivo muito simples: são caros. São menos acessíveis e menos utilizados pelas montadoras inicialmente porque ainda são muito caros. 

Como o próprio nome já indica qual é o princípio de funcionamento deste sensor, após vermos o vídeo sobre Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging), agora não estamos mais usando ondas de rádio, estamos usando luz agora. Como estamos usando luz em feixes muito direcionados, na prática chamamos isso de laser.

Lidar is a technology capable of measuring Continental drift, Determining the composition of Earth atmosphere, Discovering lost cities, tracking the biomass in forests, assessing flood risks and hurricane damage, measuring the melting of glaciers, detecting supermerged explosives and the level of the seas in which they lean, listening to stinkberg conversations, guiding missiles and self driving cars in the whole lot more. In this video I will be talking about the history of the lighter discovery of early the beginning is very straight forward forward this technology 1st flicker occurred between the years of a self educated mentally troubled Irish who lived with his parents on the outskirts of the blink and corresponded with Albert Einstein. Edward Hutchinson Singh also known as hachi was born in 1890 12 well-to-do family in Dublin He was a very ahead of his time person.

LiDAR also belongs to the group of active sensors. The basic principle is based on emitting beams of laser light and measuring the time it takes the light to bounce back from objects and return to the sensor. The most prominent LiDAR types currently used in autonomous vehicle are top-mounted devices on the roof of the vehicle, spinning rapidly in a 360 degree arc and generating thousands of measurements per second. Such rotating LiDAR sensors create very accurate 3D point maps of the surrounding environments and as a result can detect vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and other obstacles. This sensor type is also called scanning LiDAR, because it needs to move its parts to progressively raster ("scan") the field of view.
